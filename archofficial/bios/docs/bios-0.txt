    --------------- BIOS Functions ---------------

        These functions are stored in the IVT and can be called using 'INT'

        0x10:                       getbiosver - moves BIOS version to AX

        0x11:                       getcserial - waits for chatacter to be
                                    inputted from serial terminal while
                                    displayinga blinking cursor. Stores
                                    character in AX
        
        0x20:                       printstr - prints a null-terminated string
                                    located in address pointed to by AX to
                                    serial console

        0x21:                       printnum - prints numerical value of AX to
                                    serial console


    ------------- Bootup Procedure: --------------

        The first thing that BIOS does is load its own functions into the IVT
        (Interrupt Vector Table)

        The IVT is the first 512 bytes of memory that contain addresses to functions.
        When INT is called, it calls the function stored at that address.

        Next, BIOS will display a few messages:
            'ArchOfficial BIOS v0'
            'Searching for bootable disk...'

        It will then look at the last two bytes of the MBR (first 512 bytes of storage)

        If the bytes are 0x55AA, BIOS will know that the storage is bootable
        and will load the MBR at memory locations 512-1023 (right after the IVT)

        It will also display:
            'Bootable disk found. Booting disk...'

        Then, it will jump to memory location 512 (Where MBR is loaded to)

        If the last two bytes of the MBR are not 0x55AA, BIOS will display:
            'This disk is not bootable.'
        
        And then enter an infinite loop.
