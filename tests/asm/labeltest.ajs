!,This is a simple test to see if labels work;
!,After coding the truth machine without labels;
!,I realized that if I actually wanted to do anything with Arch.js, I needed labels;

!,Loads the location of the "loop" label into the index registers;

lda,:loop;
mw,a,'A';

!,Defines where that label actually is. (By the way, these can be anything as long as they dont contain
!,commas or semicolons. Just keep in mind how the assembler works.)

label,loop;
outb,a,0;

!,Jumps;
jnz,1;
