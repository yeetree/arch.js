!,This is a simple truth machine;
!,Keep in mind, the jumps set with lda are referencing memory locations;
!,At the time of writing this, I haven't added labels yet;

!,Input character and display it;
inb,a,0;
outb,a,0;

!,See if it is equal to '1';
!,This sets the flags register to 2 if it is equal;
!,If not, it will be set to 0;
cmp,a,'1';

!,If it is, jump past next code block;
lda,19;
jnz,f;

!,Else, do nothing;
lda,14;
jnz,1;

!,forever print '1';
lda,25;
mw,a,'1';
outb,a,0;
jnz,1;
