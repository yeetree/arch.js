!,This is a simple truth machine, but with labels!;
!,This time, I used labels so I don't have to keep track of memory locations;
!,Since this compiles to the exact same code, I'm not going to include a binary just for this version.

!,Input character and display it;
inb,a,0;
outb,a,0;

!,See if it is equal to '1';
!,This sets the flags register to 2 if it is equal;
!,If not, it will be set to 0;
cmp,a,'1';

!,If it is, jump past next code block;
lda,:true;
jnz,f;

!,Else, do nothing;
label,false;
lda,:false;
jnz,1;

!,forever print '1';
label,true;
lda,:true;
mw,a,'1';
outb,a,0;
jnz,1;
